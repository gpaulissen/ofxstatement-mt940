Sample plugin for ofxstatement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project provides a boilerplate for custom plugins for ofxstatement.

`ofxstatement`_ is a tool to convert proprietary bank statement to OFX format,
suitable for importing to GnuCash. Plugin for ofxstatement parses a
particular proprietary bank statement format and produces common data
structure, that is then formatted into an OFX file.

Users of ofxstatement have developed several plugins for their banks. They are
listed on main `ofxstatement`_ site. If your bank is missing, you can develop
your own plugin.

Setting up development environment
==================================

It is recommended to use ``virtualenv`` make a clean development environment.
Setting up dev environment for writing a plugin is easy::

  $ git clone https://github.com/kedder/ofxstatement-sample ofxstatement-yourbank
  $ cd ofxstatement-yourbank
  $ virtualenv -p python3 --no-site-packages .venv
  $ . .venv/bin/activate
  (.venv)$ python setup.py develop

This will download all the dependencies and install them into your virtual
environment. After this, you should be able to do::

  (.venv)$ ofxstatement list-plugins
  The following plugins are available:

    sample           Sample plugin (for developers only)



Your own plugin
===============

To create your own plugin, follow these steps:

* Edit ``setup.py`` and provide relevant metadata for your plugin.  Pay
  close attention to ``entry_points`` parameter to ``setup`` function: it
  lists plugins you are registering within ofxstatement. Give meaningful
  name to the plugin and provide plugin class name
* Replace contents of ``README.rst`` with description of your plugin
* Rename ``ofxstatement/plugins/sample.py`` to match plugin package name
  you have provided in ``entry_points`` parameter.
* Open renamed sample.py and rename ``SamplePlugin`` and ``SampleParser``
  classes to match your plugin class name.
* Now, draw the rest of the owl (c).

Your ``StatementParser`` is the main object that does all the hard work. It
has only one public method: ``parse()``, that should return
``ofxstatement.statement.Statement`` object, filled with data from given input.
The default implementation, however, splits this work into two parts:
``split_records()`` to split the whole file into logical parts, e.g.
transaction records, and ``parse_record()`` to extract information from
individual record. See ``src/ofxstatement/parser.py`` for details. If your
statement' format looks like CSV file, you might find ``CsvStatementParser``
class useful: it simplifies mapping bettween CSV columns and ``StatementLine``
attributes.

``Plugin`` interface consists only of ``get_parser()`` method, that returns
configured StatementParser object for given input filename. Docstrings on
Plugin class is also useful for describing the purpose of your plugin. First
line of it is visible in ``ofxstatement list-plugins`` output.

Testing
=======

Test your code as you would do with any other project.  To make sure
ofxstatement is still able to load your plugin, run::

  (.venv)$ ofxstatement list-plugins

You should be able to see your plugin listed.

After you are done
==================

After your plugin is ready, feel free to open an issue on `ofxstatement`_
project to include your plugin in "known plugin list". That would hopefully
make life of other clients of your bank easier.
